# Fine-Tuning-EfficientNetB0
This project applies CNNs for food image classification using the Food-101 dataset. By fine-tuning EfficientNetB0 with transfer learning and data augmentation, we improve on the 56.4% AlexNet baseline, reaching 80.7% accuracy. Results show potential for dietary tracking, nutrition assessment, and recommendation systems.
